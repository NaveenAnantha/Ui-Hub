Dynamic Table Generator with Auto-Calculations
This project is designed to dynamically generate table headers based on object keys in an array of data. Additionally, certain input fields within the table will automatically calculate and display results based on user inputs. This functionality is ideal for applications where the data structure may change or where real-time calculations are required, such as in financial apps, data analytics, or dynamic dashboards.

Highlights
Dynamic Table Headers:
The table headers are automatically generated based on the keys of objects in the provided data array. This feature allows the table structure to adjust seamlessly to different data formats.

Auto-Calculation of Results:
Some input fields within the table are programmed to automatically calculate results as the user inputs data. This ensures that values are updated in real time without requiring manual refreshes.

Features
Automatic Header Generation:
Based on the provided data array, the table headers are dynamically generated to match the keys of the objects. This ensures that even if the data changes, the table will adjust accordingly.

Real-time Calculations:
Input fields that require calculations (e.g., totals, averages) automatically update based on user input. This ensures users see live updates without needing to reload or submit the form.

Responsive Design:
The table adjusts to various screen sizes and can be used effectively on mobile devices.

Easy to Integrate:
The core functionality is encapsulated in simple components, making it easy to integrate into larger applications.
